Some machine learning techniques used for the prediction of the occurrence of heart diseases that are surveyed are support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), 
K-nearest neighbour (KNN), Random Forest etc. Then, the average prediction accuracy was calculated for each technique to find out overall best performing technique. So
that we can find the best accuracy model in predicting the Heart Disease.
